Problem:

In order for the logistics sector to store items systematically, they need the quality team to release these items systematically. The team spent an average of 90 minutes/day performing this activity and had no guarantee of process standardization.

Solution:

The automation created in VBA with integration with SAP brought the following gains:
Reduction of time spent on this activity from 90 minutes/day to 0, with an annual 5% increase in team productivity.
Reduction of approximately 9,000 reais in expenses for the company.
Process standardization (lean)
Innovation

VBA Code Documentation for SAP Process Automation
This README file is documentation for two VBA codes: Generate_list_Automation and Automation_SKIP.
Both codes must be executed in the same order through the Windows task scheduler.

Generate_list_Automation Code
This code is responsible for generating a SKIP/LOT list in the SAP system and saving them to a file in XLSX format.

How to execute the code:

Open Microsoft Excel and press Alt + F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor.
Create a new module and copy the Generate_list_Automation code into it.
Save the file with the .xlsm extension and close Excel.
Schedule the file execution through the Windows task scheduler.
Code Flow:
The code begins by defining the necessary variables for the process.
Then the code initiates integration with SAP and opens the COOIS transaction with the command "/ncoois".
The code selects the production order according to start date, end date, and status.
Next, the code selects the production order column and exports it to an XLSX file.
Finally, the file is saved in a standard directory.

Automation_SKIP Code

This code is responsible for downloading the file generated by the Generate_list_Automation code and performing a series of treatments to release the SKIP files to the SAP system.

How to execute the code:

Open Microsoft Excel and press Alt + F11 to open the Visual Basic Editor.
Create a new module and copy the Automation_SKIP code into it.
Save the file with the .xlsm extension and close Excel.
Schedule the file execution through the Windows task scheduler.

Code Flow:

The code begins by defining the necessary variables for the process.
Then the code initiates integration with SAP and opens the QA32 transaction with the command "/nqa32".
The code selects the SKIP worksheet.
The code exports the SKIP worksheet to an XLSX file.
The code saves the file in a standard directory.
Finally, the code closes SAP and Excel.

We hope this documentation helps you understand how the Generate_list_Automation and Automation_SKIP codes work and how to successfully execute them. If you need more information or technical support, please contact the development team.
